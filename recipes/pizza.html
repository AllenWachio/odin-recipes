    </ul>
     
    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>For the dough, dissolve yeast and sugar in warm water. Let sit for 5-10 minutes, until frothy.</li>
        <li>In a large bowl, combine flour and salt. Make a well in the center and pour in the yeast mixture and olive oil.</li>
        <li>Mix until dough comes together. Knead on a floured surface for about 5-7 minutes, until smooth and elastic.</li>
        <li>Place dough in a lightly oiled bowl, cover with a damp cloth, and let rise in a warm place for 1-2 hours, or until doubled in size.</li>
        <li>For the sauce, combine tomato sauce, oregano, basil, garlic powder, salt, and pepper in a bowl. Set aside.</li>
        <li>Preheat oven to 475°F (245°C). If using a pizza stone, place it in the oven while preheating.</li>
        <li>Punch down dough and divide into two portions if making two pizzas. Roll out on a floured surface to desired thickness.</li>
        <li>Transfer dough to a pizza peel or baking sheet. Spread sauce over the dough, leaving a border for the crust.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle with cheese and add your desired toppings.</li>
        <li>Bake for 12-15 minutes, or until crust is golden and cheese is bubbly and melted.</li>
        <li>Let cool for a few minutes before slicing.</li>
    </ol>
