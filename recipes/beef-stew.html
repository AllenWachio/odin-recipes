        <li>1 large onion, chopped</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>4 cups beef broth</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>3 large carrots, peeled and sliced</li>
        <li>2 potatoes, peeled and cubed</li>
        <li>2 celery stalks, sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup frozen peas</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon Worcestershire sauce</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon dried thyme</li>
        <li>1 bay leaf</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons all-purpose flour (optional, for thickening)</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Procedure</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil in a large pot over medium-high heat. Add the beef cubes and brown on all sides. Remove beef and set aside.</li>
        <li>In the same pot, add onion and garlic. Cook until softened, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Return beef to the pot. Stir in the tomato paste, then add beef broth, water, Worcestershire sauce, thyme, and bay leaf.</li>
        <li>Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to low. Cover and simmer for 1.5 hours.</li>
        <li>Add carrots, potatoes, and celery. Continue simmering for another 30 minutes, or until vegetables and beef are tender.</li>
        <li>If the stew needs thickening, mix flour with a small amount of cold water to form a slurry and stir into the stew. Simmer for a few more minutes.</li>
        <li>Add peas, season with salt and pepper, and cook for an additional 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Remove bay leaf before serving.</li>
    </ol>
